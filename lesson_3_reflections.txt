When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If I work on a multiple locations or multiple computers or my repository has more contributors than just me.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	So I can make my own changes to repository and push and pull only when I'm ready.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork happens inside GitHub
	Clone copies GitHub repository to your local machine
	Branches are for trying new things


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	I don't need internet access.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Via email
